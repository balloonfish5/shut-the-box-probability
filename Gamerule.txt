Shut the box (My version)
Player starts with 9 tiles numbering from 1-9.
Then player rolls the 2 dices and shut 1 or 2 tiles which sum is equal to the dice sum.
The player wins if all the tiles are shut and loses when no combination of tiles sastify the dice sum.
The winning chance when played perfectly in this case is 4.93581337725346%
